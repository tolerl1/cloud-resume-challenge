Serverless resume website with view counter using AWS. Built to participate in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/forrest-brazeal"/>Forrest Brazeal's</a> Cloud Resume <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/instructions/">Challenge</a>. 

This <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/instructions/">16-step challenge</a> requires the creation of a website to showcase my resume with a site view counter. It dives deeper by requiring the use of AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB to operate the view counter, host the site on an S3 bucket, and have the site delivered over HTTPS using CloudFront. Additionally, this all must be automated using the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) and a CI/CD pipeline.
